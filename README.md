# Telecom-Customer-Churn-Prediction


# Problem Statement

You have a telecom firm which has collected data of all its customers. The main types of attributes are:

- Demographics (age, gender etc.)
- Services availed (internet packs purchased, special offers taken etc.)
- Expenses (amount of recharge done per month etc.)


Based on all this past information, you want to build a model which will predict whether a particular customer will churn or not, i.e. whether they will switch to a different service provider or not. So the variable of interest, i.e. the target variable here is ‘Churn’ which will tell us whether or not a particular customer has churned. It is a binary variable - 1 means that the customer has churned and 0 means the customer has not churned.

# Steps Involved

This will involve all the steps such as:

- Data cleaning and preparation
- Preprocessing steps
- Test-train split
- Feature scaling
- Model Building using RFE, p-values and VIFs
- Confusion Matrix
- ROC-AOC Curve
